- 👋 Hi, I’m Linux User Lucario!
- 👀 I’m interested in Pokémon, Linux and old technology!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift programming (see MacPokédex)!
- 📫 How to reach me: just use jffbk@outlook.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once used Arch Linux for 5 months on my main laptop (Dell Inspiron 14 5410 2-in-1)!

I use `sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root` daily (in my dreams, I would never do that on my laptop)!
