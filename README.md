-- CURRENTLY MOVING TO GITLAB (https://gitlab.com/linuxuserlucario) --

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Linux User Lucario!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in PokÃ©mon, Linux and old technology!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift programming (see MacPokÃ©dex)!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: just use jffbk@outlook.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once used Arch Linux for 5 months on my main laptop (Dell Inspiron 14 5410 2-in-1)!

I use `sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root` daily (in my dreams, I would never do that on my laptop)!
